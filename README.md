# Fluid Page Cache *for TYPO3 CMS*

This TYPO3 CMS extension allows you to clear frontend page caches, **automatically** when a displayed
record has been updated. It recognizes which variables have been used in the Fluid templates on current
page and assigns additional cache_tags to page cache.

This allows the shipped after save-hook to only delete pages from cache, which actually used the
edited record.

**Once EXT:fluid_page_cache is installed, your page cache is as precise as possible, with zero configuration.**
