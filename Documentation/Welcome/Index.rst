Welcome
=======

The Fluid Page Cache extension for TYPO3 CMS, allows you to create **high precise page cache tags**,
with **zero configuration**.

Once installed, all entities you use in your Fluid templates will **automatically** create a new cache tag
for current page cache variation.

Fluid Page Cache also provides an Info module, which visualizes the cache entries of each page (variation).

**The following screenshot, displays a single detail page of EXT:news.**

The yellow marked entries are provides by news. ``pageId_1`` is provided by the core itself.
All others are generated automatically, based on the actual used entities, by fluid_page_cache.

Because **all actual used entities** have a **corresponding cache tag** now, you can precisely clear only
those cache entries, without affecting other pages. fluid_page_cache ships an after-save-hook, which does this for you.

.. hint::
   With **fluid_page_cache** installed almost all your page cache problems are a thing of the past.

In next chapter, the concept of fluid_page_cache is explained in detail.
